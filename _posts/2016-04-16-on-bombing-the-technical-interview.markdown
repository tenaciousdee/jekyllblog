title:  "On bombing the technical interview"
---

I'm writing this fresh off a pretty embarrassing scenario in which I essentially came off as a total clueless beginner during a technical interview. Multiple questions have popped in my head since, such as: "Can nerves really make someone forget everything they know?", "Is it possible that I'm not as experienced as I like to think?", "Should I go back to school?", and many more of the like.

The truth is, I don't know what went wrong, maybe I'm too slow or inexperienced, maybe the pressure of being put on the spot got to me, who knows, but the truth is I can't dwell on any of that, I have to keep a positive outlook and move forward. I have to learn from this experience and not lose hope in finding the right software engineering position.

That being said, a positive attitude isn't the only thing that'll help me prepare and improve in time for my next interview, so here are a few things I'll be doing:

 **1. Practice, Practice, Practice** - While I've convinced myself that I understand the languages in my stack on a higher level, sometimes it's those small pesky details that get you when you're put on the spot. Do I need a semi-colon here, how do I add a key/value pair to a hash, those small gotchas that should be ingrained in our minds, but we soon forget because we've learned so much since then. A few exercises I'll be trying:

   * [Front End Software Engineer Questions](https://www.careercup.com/page?pid=front-end-software-engineer-interview-questions)


 **2. Read** - Perhaps I'm the only software engineer in the world who has yet to read a book on those terrifying technical interviews, if so, I mean to change that at once.

 **3. Mock Interviews** - Just as important as it is to practice actual algorithms, interviewing itself is a skill and therefore something that can only improve with practice. I plan on talking to more experienced professionals and picking their brains on how to improve my interview skills. Not all of us have access to such professionals, however, so it helps that there are mentoring services online to help with just that:

I wrote this post to keep myself accountable, to vent a bit and to remind myself to stay positive, but if anybody out there happens upon this writing, I hope this helps you a bit, if anything to remind you that you're not the only one out there who's faced defeat and failure in this field. Let's keep reminding ourselves to be confident and that we're not [imposters](https://www.braintreepayments.com/blog/overcoming-imposter-syndrome/).
