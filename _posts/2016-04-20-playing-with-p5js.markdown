I have a mild obsession with geometric backgrounds. With the growing popularity and support (finally!) of SVG, it's been fun to come up with some fun shapes and backgrounds as seen below (hover for full effect):

<p data-height="266" data-theme-id="light" data-slug-hash="WrZvpv" data-default-tab="result" data-user="tenaciousdee" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/tenaciousdee/pen/WrZvpv/">SVG Geometric Pattern</a> by Dennise Saxton (<a href="http://codepen.io/tenaciousdee">@tenaciousdee</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

But what's even more popular than SVG? Why Javascript, of course! So naturally, I was dying to start playing around with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). I will warn you, it's a bit overwhelming at first, but once you figure out how it works, it's not too bad. I'd especially recommend it if you're looking to practice your JS skills, I came out with a slightly better understanding of working with [JS objects, prototype and inheritance](http://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html).

If you'd like to see my result, check it out [here](http://p5js.dennisesaxton.com/) and [here](https://github.com/tenaciousdee/p5js-practice).
